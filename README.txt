Invoice and Inventory Management System

package.json
npm install

src/lib/supabase.ts
src/App.tsx
src/components/Layout.tsx
src/pages/Auth.tsx
src/pages/Dashboard.tsx
npm run dev
I've started building a comprehensive invoice and inventory management system. Here's what I've set up so far:

Database Schema:

Products table for inventory management
Customers table for client information
Invoices and invoice_items tables for billing
Stock movements table for inventory tracking
Row Level Security (RLS) policies for data protection
Frontend Structure:

Modern, responsive layout with sidebar navigation
Dashboard with key metrics (total products, low stock alerts, monthly revenue, pending invoices)
Authentication system using Supabase
React Router for navigation
Core Features:

User authentication
Real-time dashboard statistics
Inventory tracking
Invoice management
Stock movement tracking
Before proceeding, you'll need to:
